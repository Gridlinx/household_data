# Household data package

This repository contains scripts to create time series data of detailed household consumption and generation. It includes data of small businesses, as well as private households, in a resolution up to single device consumptions.

All time series were collected during the course of the European [CoSSMic](http://cossmic.eu/) (**Co**llaborating **S**mart **S**olar-powered **Mic**rogrids) project. The consortium addressed the coupling of solar panels with smart energy sharing solutions and storage capabilities, while researching a decentralized, agent-based model approach, to optimize the potentials to exchange energy inside small communities.

*The CoSSMic project has received funding from the European Commission under the FP7 framework.*

See the [main Jupyter notebook](main.ipynb) for further details.
